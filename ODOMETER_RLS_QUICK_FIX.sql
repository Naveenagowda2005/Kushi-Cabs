-- ============================================================
-- Quick Fix: Drop all broken odometer RLS policies and recreate
-- Root cause: bucket_id is UUID, not text. Text = UUID fails
-- Solution: Use subquery to compare UUID properly
-- ============================================================

-- Drop ALL existing odometer policies (broken ones)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Drivers can upload odometer images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can view odometer images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Drivers can update odometer images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can upload odometer images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can view odometer images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own odometer images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own odometer images" ON storage.objects;

-- ============================================================
-- Create correct RLS policies with UUID comparison
-- ============================================================

-- Policy 1: Any authenticated user can upload
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload odometer images"
  ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id IN (SELECT id FROM storage.buckets WHERE name = 'odometer-images')
  );

-- Policy 2: Anyone can view (public bucket)
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view odometer images"
  ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
  TO public
  USING (
    bucket_id IN (SELECT id FROM storage.buckets WHERE name = 'odometer-images')
  );

-- Policy 3: Authenticated users can update their own
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own odometer images"
  ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    bucket_id IN (SELECT id FROM storage.buckets WHERE name = 'odometer-images')
    AND owner_id = auth.uid()
  );

-- Policy 4: Authenticated users can delete their own
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own odometer images"
  ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    bucket_id IN (SELECT id FROM storage.buckets WHERE name = 'odometer-images')
    AND owner_id = auth.uid()
  );

SELECT 'Odometer RLS policies fixed - UUID comparison now correct' AS status;
